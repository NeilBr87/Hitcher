# Hitcher

Hitcher is a game I'm working on, the first (comparatively) largescale game I've worked on using React. The concept is simple - you've got to cross Europe only by hitchiking, reaching a set of end-destinations. Along the way, you'll have to manage your food, health and money, and find yourself tested by a set of random events.

## Status 

This app is in development. I'll deploy the game as soon as I have done the below

**Finalised the UI**
**Completed the list of random events and choices**
**Ensured full map and town image integration**
**Created an artificial backend by saving progress locally**

## Basic design

This is a very basic UI design - something better to follow!
