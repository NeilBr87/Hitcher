# Plan

✔️ - Done  
🟠 - In progress  
❌ - Not started  

Plan as follows:

1. Create basic app framework for stable day loop: ✔️
2. Create transport matrix using townPotentials object: ✔️ (Full list AI-generated but needs to be checked and expanded)
3. Link menu:
* Town menu: ✔️
* Map: 🟠 (UK map created, need to create others and link to location using if statements)
* Reward Cities: ✔️
* Deliveries: ❌ - possible future update
* Ferry list: ❌
* Main menu: ✔️
4. Evening menu: ✔️
5. Explore menu: 🟠 - still need to program walk menu
6. Travel with random events: 🟠 - still need to program outcomes for additional options
7. Stable day/time loop: ✔️ (Day stable, time configured to elapse for hitchhiking, needs to elapse inside explore menu)
8. Commit to UI: ✔️ (Probably similar to what I've got now, or total overhaul. Both for town menu and overall container)
9. Outside menu: ✔️ (Need main menu and introductory text)
10. Progress saving: ❌ (Probably using localStorage. Want users to be able to pick up progress from same device)
11. Game over settings: End when health reaches zero, losing health when food runs out: ❌
11. Endgame options - end cities/giving up/multiple runs etc: ❌ 
12. Add music: ❌ (Need to find music that fits the theme. Not a priority)
